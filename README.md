## Project description
Pinterest crunches billions of data points every day to decide how to provide more value to their users. In this project, you'll create a similar system using the AWS Cloud.
My task was to produce a system that stores a given company data in a database so that it can be accessed from one centralised location and acts as the single source for sales data.
